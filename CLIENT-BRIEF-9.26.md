# Client Brief

### **Team Name**: PuppyLover


### **Client**: BC Cancer

### **High-Level Problem Description**

The BC Cancer Foundation relies on donor engagement to support its fundraising efforts, primarily using **Raiserâ€™s Edge** as its CRM system to track interactions, donor information, and manage event invitations. However, the current process of managing and reviewing invite lists for events presents several challenges:

1. **Manual, Time-Consuming Processes**: The process of generating invite lists can take **up to 6 weeks** due to multiple manual steps, such as pulling data from the CRM, reviewing lists, and manually updating the information in Excel.

2. **Disconnected and Outdated Data**: Once data is pulled into **Excel**, it becomes disconnected from the central system, causing data to become outdated quickly and leading to repeated manual updates.

3. **No Feedback Loop**: There is no automated system in place to track feedback or adjustments made to invite lists. As a result, fundraisers often find themselves repeating tasks or re-inviting the same donors multiple times without considering past interactions or responses.

4. **Excel Limitations**: The reliance on **Excel** causes multiple pain points, such as lagging with large data sets, sorting/filtering issues, and difficulties in navigating large volumes of information. Mistakes during manual sorting and filtering lead to incorrect data management and donor miscommunication.

5. **Inefficient Regional and Interest-Based Filtering**: Donors from regions unrelated to specific events (e.g., Vancouver Island vs. Kelowna) sometimes receive irrelevant invitations. Additionally, donor interests (e.g., AI in cancer vs. breast cancer) are not always accurately reflected in invite lists, requiring manual checks.

6. **Duplicate Entries for Related Accounts**: In cases where donors have related accounts (e.g., businesses or spouses), multiple invitations are sometimes sent to the same donor or related entities, requiring fundraisers to manually exclude these extra accounts.

7. **Frequent Manual Reminders and Deadline Management**: Coordinators like Cindy have to constantly remind fundraisers to complete their review tasks. There is no automated system for tracking task completion, leading to inefficiencies in the overall process.

### **Wants & Needs**

The BC Cancer Foundation aims to address these challenges by implementing a system that:

- **Automates and streamlines the invite list creation process**, reducing the reliance on manual steps and Excel.
- **Improves data integration** between the invite lists and the CRM system, ensuring that data remains up-to-date and connected to donor profiles.
- **Introduces a feedback loop** that tracks donor interactions and helps avoid repeating tasks or sending redundant invitations.
- **Provides better filtering and sorting tools** to ensure relevant donors are selected for specific events based on their location, interests, and previous interactions.
- **Handles related accounts automatically**, ensuring that duplicate entries are removed without requiring manual exclusion by fundraisers.
- **Reduces manual oversight** by automating reminders and task tracking for coordinators.
