### **High-Level Problem Description**

The BC Cancer Foundation relies on donor engagement to support its fundraising efforts, primarily using **Raiser's Edge** as its CRM system. However, the current process of managing and reviewing invite lists for events presents several challenges across three key stages:

1. **Candidate Selection Stage**
   - Manual, Time-Consuming Processes: Generating invite lists can take **up to 6 weeks** due to multiple manual steps, such as pulling data from the CRM, reviewing lists, and manually updating information in Excel.
   - Disconnected and Outdated Data: Once data is pulled into **Excel**, it becomes disconnected from the central system, causing data to become outdated quickly and leading to repeated manual updates.
   - Excel Limitations: Reliance on **Excel** causes multiple pain points, such as lagging with large data sets, sorting/filtering issues, and difficulties in navigating large volumes of information. Mistakes during manual sorting and filtering lead to incorrect data management and donor miscommunication.
   - Inefficient Regional and Interest-Based Filtering: Donors from unrelated regions sometimes receive irrelevant invitations. Additionally, donor interests are not always accurately reflected in invite lists, requiring manual checks.
   - Duplicate Entries for Related Accounts: In cases where donors have related accounts (e.g., businesses or spouses), multiple invitations are sometimes sent to the same donor or related entities, requiring fundraisers to manually exclude these extra accounts.

2. **Coordinator Management Stage**
   - Frequent Manual Reminders: Coordinators like Cindy have to constantly remind fundraisers to complete their review tasks.
   - Lack of Automated Task Tracking: There is no automated system for tracking task completion, leading to inefficiencies in the overall process.
   - Deadline Management Challenges: The manual nature of the process makes it difficult to effectively manage and enforce deadlines for list reviews and updates.

3. **Feedback and Improvement Stage**
   - No Feedback Loop: There is no automated system in place to track feedback or adjustments made to invite lists. 
   - Repetitive Tasks: As a result of the lack of feedback integration, fundraisers often find themselves repeating tasks or re-inviting the same donors multiple times without considering past interactions or responses.
   - Inability to Learn from Past Events: The current system doesn't allow for easy analysis of past event successes or failures, making it difficult to improve future invitation strategies.
