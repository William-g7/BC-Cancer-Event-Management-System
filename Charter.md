Ensure that the documentation is clear and understandable for future reference by team members or stakeholders.

## Team Values and Norms
We commit to upholding the following values and norms to foster a positive and productive team environment:
1. **Respect:** Team members will show respect by actively listening to each other, valuing different perspectives, and maintaining open and constructive communication. We will avoid interrupting others and will always approach feedback with empathy and professionalism.
2. **Trust:** Trust will be maintained by ensuring transparency in our work and being accountable for our responsibilities. Team members will follow through on their commitments, communicate openly about challenges, and rely on each other’s expertise to achieve shared goals.
3. **Punctuality:** All team members are expected to attend meetings on time and be prepared to contribute. If a member is unable to attend, they should notify the team in advance and provide any necessary updates on their tasks. Punctuality shows respect for everyone’s time and helps maintain a smooth workflow.
4. **Commitment to Quality:** We will adhere to high standards of quality in our work by paying attention to detail, thoroughly reviewing our output, and seeking feedback where needed. Each team member is responsible for delivering work that meets the agreed-upon criteria and reflects the collective effort of the team.

## Decision-Making Process
Decisions within the team will be made using the following process:
1. **Consensus:** Whenever possible, decisions will be made through consensus, where all team members discuss and contribute to the decision. The goal is to reach a mutually acceptable agreement where everyone feels heard and their concerns are addressed.
2. **Majority Vote:** If consensus cannot be reached in a timely manner, a majority vote will be used to make decisions. Each member will have one vote, and the option with the most votes will be chosen. Majority voting will be used primarily for non-critical decisions or when time constraints are an issue.
3. **Designated Decision-Maker:** For specific areas of expertise, a designated decision-maker will be assigned authority to make final decisions. These roles will be clearly identified at the beginning of the project, and their decisions will be respected by the entire team.

## Communication Plan
Effective communication is crucial for our success. Our communication plan includes:
1. **Tools:** text messages, e-mails, face to face and Teams meetings
2. **Frequency:** twice a week for updates and meetings
3. **Reporting:** At the start of each meeting, every team member will give a brief update summarizing their progress, challenges, and any support they need. Additionally, the team's collective progress will be documented weekly in the StandUpDocuments on GitHub.

## Conflict Resolution Mechanisms
Conflicts will be addressed promptly using the following mechanisms:
1. **Open Discussion:** Create an environment that encourages open and respectful conversations. When team members have different viewpoints, start by providing positive feedback and then engage in constructive discussions about the pros and cons of each idea. The team should operate with the mindset that every idea is valuable, allowing for more diverse and creative solutions.
2. **Mediation:** Mediation process involves the following steps:
Step 1: Pause and Reflect:
Encourage all members to take a moment to step back, cool down, and approach the situation with a clear, calm mindset.
Step 2: Acknowledge the Conflict:
Recognize that conflicts can happen in a team setting, and frame it as an opportunity for growth and improved communication.
Step 3: Facilitate Dialogue: 
Allow each person to express their perspective without interruptions, ensuring that everyone feels heard.
Step 4: Focus on Solutions: 
Guide the conversation towards finding common ground and potential solutions, rather than dwelling on the disagreement.
Step 5: Follow-Up: 
After reaching a resolution, check in with all members to ensure the solution is working and there are no lingering issues. 
3. **Escalation:** Steps for escalating unresolved conflicts:
Step 1: Direct Discussion: 
Engage in a one-on-one conversation with the involved team member(s) to pinpoint the root cause of the conflict and explore collaborative solutions.
Step 2: Reconfirm the Situation: 
Reconfirm that all attempts at open discussion and mediation have been exhausted without a resolution.
Step 3: Course Instructor Involvement:
As a final step, if the conflict remains unresolved, escalate the conflict to the course instructor by providing a detailed report that includes a summary of the conflict, mediation attempts, and actions taken to resolve the issue,and request further guidance.    

## Performance Expectations
We have set the following performance expectations to maintain high standards:
1. **Metrics:** [List performance metrics]
2. **Goals:** [Set specific performance goals]
3. **Feedback:** [Describe how feedback will be provided and used]

## Meeting Schedules and Agendas
Regular meetings will be scheduled as follows:
1. **Frequency:** Friday Morning 10 am.
2. **Agenda:** Agendas will be prepared by the team member by Thursday mid-night before each meeting.
3. **Minutes:** One team member will be assigned to take minutes during each meeting. The minutes will include key decisions, action items, and deadlines. The minutes will sent to the team through e-mail before Friday midnight.

## Ensuring Adherence to the Charter
To ensure we adhere to this charter, we will:
1. **Regular Reviews:** The team will review the charter every month to ensure it remains relevant and we are following its guidelines. If any major project changes occur, a review will be scheduled immediately to address potential adjustments.
2. **Accountability:** Team members will hold each other accountable through regular check-ins and progress updates during meetings.
3. **Flexibility:** If adjustments to the charter are needed, they will be proposed during the monthly review and require a consensus among all team members.
4. **Leadership:** The team lead will be responsible for enforcing the charter and ensuring adherence. If the lead is unavailable, a designated alternate will assume this responsibility to maintain consistency in leadership.

## Conclusion
This team charter is essential for our collaboration and success. 
By following the guidelines and commitments outlined above, we can work effectively towards our shared objectives.
