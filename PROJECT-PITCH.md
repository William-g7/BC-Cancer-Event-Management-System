## What Went Well

- One of the most distinguished aspects of our presentation compared to other groups was the use of **Figma to create a vivid wireframe**. This made our project vision incredibly clear, giving the audience a concrete sense of what we aim to build.

- Another strength was the **clarity and logical flow** of the presentation. We first introduced the problem background, followed by a clear explanation of our objectives. Then, we presented potential solutions, displayed the wireframe, showcased the timeline, and finally discussed the technical aspects. This structure made the presentation well-organized and professional.

- Our **team collaboration** was smooth throughout the process. Each member took responsibility for their part, and we maintained timely communication, ensuring that everyone stayed aligned and contributed to the final product effectively.

## What would we do better next time
List the areas where you want to improve your presentation

- **Practice for Smoother Delivery** Although our team collaboration was strong, additional practice runs would help improve our confidence and timing. This would ensure each segment transitions seamlessly and that we all stay within our allotted time, making the overall presentation even more polished and engaging.
  
- **Addressing Potential Risks and Contingencies** Including an outline of potential risks and contingency plans would strengthen our presentation. This would show that we've considered possible challenges in our project and have prepared strategies to handle them, demonstrating thorough planning and foresight.

- **Break Down Complex Problems into Smaller Steps** We realized that breaking down big problems into smaller, manageable steps could help simplify our explanation. This approach would allow us to demonstrate each stage of our project in a clear and digestible way, making it easier to understand our solution process and technical decisions.
