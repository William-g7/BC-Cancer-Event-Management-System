## What Went Well

- One of the most distinguished aspects of our presentation compared to other groups was the use of **canvas to create a vivid wireframe**. This made our project vision incredibly clear, giving the audience a concrete sense of what we aim to build.

- Another strength was the **clarity and logical flow** of the presentation. We first introduced the problem background, followed by a clear explanation of our objectives. Then, we presented potential solutions, displayed the wireframe, showcased the timeline, and finally discussed the technical aspects. This structure made the presentation well-organized and professional.

- Our **team collaboration** was smooth throughout the process. Each member took responsibility for their part, and we maintained timely communication, ensuring that everyone stayed aligned and contributed to the final product effectively.
