## Project Description

The BC Cancer Foundation aims to enhance donor engagement through a streamlined Donor Engagement Optimization System. This project addresses the challenges in managing event invite lists by facilitating collaboration among event organizers/fundraisers and coordinators. details of the project can be found in the [README.md](Project/README.md) file.

The web application is organized within the `donor-engagement-system` folder, which contains three main components:

1. **Backend**: The backend is built using TypeScript and Node.js, utilizing the Express framework to handle API requests. It manages donor data, events, and fundraising activities, providing a robust API for the frontend to interact with. The backend also includes a MySQL database for data storage.

2. **SQL**: The SQL scripts are included to set up the database schema and seed initial data. These scripts define the structure of the database tables and relationships, ensuring that the application has the necessary data to function correctly.

3. **Frontend**: The frontend is developed using React and Material-UI, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the donor engagement system. It allows users to view events, manage donors, and collaborate on fundraising efforts.
