## Overview
The purpose of this retrospective is to document our activities in the last week, allowing us to gain a better understanding of each team member's contributions.

---

## What Went Well
List the things that went well during the project.
- The team collectively studied topics related to inclusive design, enhancing our understanding of how to create software that accommodates diverse user needs.
- We delved deeper into Jest testing and TypeScript, further solidifying our skills in these areas.
- We gained a better understanding of the client's requirements and, based on this, proposed three potential solutions aligned with both the needs and our technical capabilities.
- After discussions, we selected the most feasible solution to move forward with. The team also held multiple meetings to create wireframes for the proposed solution and outline the next steps for implementation.

---

## What Could Be Improved
List the areas where there is room for improvement.
- Deepen our understanding of TypeScript, especially in handling more complex use cases and advanced features.
- Improve our familiarity with Jest for testing, particularly focusing on writing comprehensive test cases and increasing code coverage.
- Enhance our ability to integrate the proposed wireframes with the actual codebase, ensuring a smooth transition from design to implementation.

## Action Items
Identify actionable steps that can be taken to improve future projects.
1. Allocate dedicated time for team members to further explore and practice advanced TypeScript features.
2. Conduct focused sessions on Jest testing to improve test writing skills and ensure higher code coverage.
3. Develop a structured approach to transitioning from wireframes to code, including setting up design implementation guidelines and reviewing the process regularly.

## Overall Team Assessment
Reflect on the team’s performance as a whole.
- **Team Strengths:**
  - The team demonstrated strong collaboration, particularly in analyzing client requirements and proposing multiple solutions for the BC Cancer project.
  - Our ability to create wireframes based on the client’s needs showcased our ability to translate project goals into actionable designs.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - The team needs to deepen its understanding of more advanced TypeScript features, especially when it comes to handling complex scenarios.
  - Transitioning from design (wireframes) to code could be smoother. We need to work on better integrating our designs into actual implementation.
- **Suggestions for Future Projects:**
  - Establish clearer guidelines for translating wireframes into working code to avoid potential mismatches or misinterpretations during implementation.
  - Ensure better time management by allocating specific roles and responsibilities to team members, which will help balance workload and learning new skills without overwhelming any individual.
