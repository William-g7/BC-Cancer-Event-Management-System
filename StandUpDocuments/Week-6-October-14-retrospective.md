## What Went Well
List the things that went well during the project.
- Successfully completed the BC Cancer project proposal
- Held a meeting with the professor and received valuable feedback
- Task distribution was clear, and all team members completed their work on time

---

## What Could Be Improved
List the areas where there is room for improvement.
- Further develop technology skills to better execute the proposed wireframe
- Hold more regular meetings during the implementation of the codebase.

## Action Items
1. Break down the project into three main areas: front-end, back-end, and database, and ensure all teams work concurrently to accelerate progress.
2. Strengthen learning of user statement-related technologies to better align the technical implementation with project requirements.
3. Schedule regular check-ins to monitor progress and address any blockers during the implementation phase.
