## Overall Team Assessment
Reflect on the team’s performance as a whole.
- **Team Strengths:**
  - The team has demonstrated strong collaboration by sharing ideas, expertise, and insights during meetings, creating a supportive and open environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing.
  - Task distribution has been well-structured, ensuring that each team member has clear responsibilities and can work on areas aligned with their strengths and interests.
  - The team has built a respectful and encouraging atmosphere, which has helped maintain motivation and morale throughout the project. Mutual support is a key element of our working dynamic, allowing members to step in and assist each other when needed.
  - Despite varying levels of familiarity with the technologies used (TypeScript, React, Node.js), team members have shown a commitment to learning, helping one another understand complex concepts, and pushing forward to improve individual and collective skills.
  - Team members are not afraid to raise questions and have actively sought out help from both the TA and the instructor, ensuring timely resolution of issues and keeping the project on track.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Some members are still developing their understanding of key technologies like TypeScript, React, Express.js, and Node.js. The team could benefit from more focused learning to deepen technical knowledge and streamline the development process.
  - With the heavy workload of other courses and deadlines, the team has faced challenges in managing time effectively. Improving time management and prioritizing tasks will help ensure smoother progress and avoid last-minute rushes.
  - Although communication has been positive, there is room to increase efficiency. More frequent and structured updates can help identify blockers early, making it easier to keep momentum and prevent delays.
- **Suggestions for Future Projects:**
  - To address the gaps in technical knowledge, we recommend setting aside time each week specifically for skill development in key technologies (TypeScript, React, Express.js, Node.js). This could include team-led sessions or pairing up for focused learning.
  - To maintain momentum and address any potential challenges quickly, we suggest holding shorter, more frequent check-ins (perhaps midweek) to share progress, ask questions, and troubleshoot issues before they become major roadblocks.
  - Clarifying roles at the start of each sprint or task can help ensure that everyone knows what they’re responsible for and can avoid overlapping efforts. This will increase accountability and help streamline the workflow.
