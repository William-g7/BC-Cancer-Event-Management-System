## Individual Self-Assessments
### [Shiyuan Chen]
- **Achievements and Contributions:**
  - design the architecture of the backend server and apply a controller-service-repository pattern to the whole project
  - finish features of show dashboard, show event lists and show donor lists
- **Challenges Faced:**
  - it is hard to test and debug so many files all together
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - improve the documentation of the project
  - improve the error handling of the functions
- **Feedback and Suggestions:**
  - The API that Juancho gives us has no function for searching for a particular donor, which can be very inconvenient. We have to change our solution to a full warehouse project.

### [Yan Wang]
- **Achievements and Contributions:**
  - Successfully implemented the login feature for the project
  - Developed a clear understanding of the frontend-backend connection
- **Challenges Faced:**
  - Encountered difficulties with advanced TypeScript skills
  - Unfamiliar with error handling part 
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Improve proficiency with advanced TypeScript concepts
  - Enhance skills in error handling 
- **Feedback and Suggestions:**
  - Seek help from teammates or instructors when facing troubles to gain new perspectives and solutions
  - Continue deepening understanding of the project's technology stack


### [Xing Gao]
### [Xing Gao]
- **Achievements and Contributions:**
  - Continued developing the database structure for the project, refining the design to ensure scalability and alignment with project requirements.
  - Collaborated closely with team members to finalize the UML diagram and database schema, discussing key design choices to address both current and future project needs.
  - Deployed updates to AWS RDS, allowing seamless remote access for all team members and facilitating integration with other project components.

- **Challenges Faced:**
  - Encountered challenges with optimizing database queries for performance, particularly with larger datasets anticipated in future phases.
  - Experienced some initial difficulties with AWS RDS configurations, including security and connection management, which required additional troubleshooting.

- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Work on optimizing database performance by exploring indexing and query refinement techniques.
  - Continue building proficiency with AWS RDS management, focusing on security practices and efficient configuration.

- **Feedback and Suggestions:**
  - Regular team discussions on database and backend practices would help reinforce knowledge across team members, allowing us to approach challenges collaboratively.
  - Establish a shared documentation resource for database configurations, query templates, and best practices to support efficient development and knowledge retention.


### Zhenziye Lin
- **Achievements and Contributions:**
  - Returned to school and actively engaged in team discussions to understand project details and responsibilities, catching up on previously missed content to get up to speed with the project.
  - Collaborated closely with team members to clarify both frontend and backend responsibilities, ensuring a solid understanding of the current code structure and goals.
  - Contributed ideas and suggestions during team meetings, particularly on areas where the frontend and backend can improve integration to enhance overall functionality.
  - Conducted independent research on the technologies being used, including frontend frameworks and backend architecture, to better understand how each component connects within the project.

- **Challenges Faced:**
  - Limited familiarity with databases, specifically in terms of writing SQL queries, understanding data structures, and configuring database connections for smooth integration with the backend.
  - Some difficulties adapting to the backend technologies being used in the project, including managing database schemas and understanding how the server handles data transactions.

- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Focus on learning SQL syntax and backend integration, including setting up and querying databases, to contribute more effectively to both frontend and backend tasks.
  - Increase familiarity with backend concepts such as API endpoints, data flow, and error handling to bridge knowledge gaps and improve collaboration with the teamâ€™s backend developers.

- **Feedback and Suggestions:**
  - Regular mini-sessions on database queries and backend concepts would be beneficial for continuous learning, helping to reinforce knowledge through hands-on practice and peer support.
  - Pair programming with more experienced team members on backend tasks could accelerate learning and provide opportunities to ask questions in real-time, facilitating a more interactive and supportive learning environment.
  - A shared documentation resource on common backend and database practices, maintained by the team, could help streamline learning and serve as a quick reference for commonly used commands and patterns.
