# Questions


## Donors Selection
1. If we need to select 100 people from an initial list of 500, how do we determine how many donors each fundraiser is allowed to choose? Is there a specific method or criteria for distributing the selection among fundraisers?
2. What is the approval process for the selection, will differnt people pick the donors together? (What is the relationship between PMM, SMM, and VMM in the selection process? Do they select people simultaneously, or is there a hierarchical workflow, such as PMM selecting first, followed by approval from SMM, and then VMM? Is the selection process structured in a way that reflects a chain of approval?)
