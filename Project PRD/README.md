# Project Description

## Project Title: Donor Engagement Optimization System

### Overview

The BC Cancer Foundation aims to enhance donor engagement through a streamlined Donor Engagement Optimization System. This project addresses the challenges in managing event invite lists by facilitating collaboration among event organizers/fundraisers, coordinators, and data specialists.

### Objectives

1. **For Event Organizers/Fundraisers**:
   - Organize the event information and specify primary parameters to query initial donor information via the API.
   - Collaborate in real-time on the initial donor list, allowing multiple users to choose donors synchronously and view each other's actions.
   - View the donor list in detail and filter out the donors who have already been selected by other fundraisers.
   - Know the deadline of the task and receive reminders from the system.
   
2. **For Coordinators**:
   - Implement a task management dashboard for tracking progress and deadlines.
   - Send reminder emails to the fundraisers.
   - Know the timeline of the task and receive reminders from the system.

3. **For Data Specialists**:
   - Manage the application and ensure data integrity and system performance.
   - Facilitate the API integration to access donor data efficiently.

### Expected Outcomes
- Improved collaboration among users in selecting donors.
- Enhanced accountability and task tracking.
- Streamlined process for generating event invite lists.

This system will empower all user roles to work more efficiently, ultimately supporting the BC Cancer Foundation's fundraising efforts.
