# MVP Presentation Summary

### [Yan Wang]
## What I Did Well
I practiced multiple times before the presentation, which made me very familiar with the content I was going to discuss. This preparation allowed me to deliver my points in a clear, well-paced manner.

## What I Can Improve On
During the presentation, I realized that I didn’t engage with our clients as much as I could have. I spent most of the time looking at the slides rather than interacting directly with the audience. In the future, I’d like to improve this by making more eye contact with the clients, asking them questions, and inviting their feedback throughout the presentation to make it feel more interactive and engaging.


### [Xing Gao]
## What I Did Well
I believe I did a good job of clearly presenting the functionality of the Donor Engagement System. I managed to control the timing effectively and maintained a good overall flow throughout the presentation, ensuring that the audience could follow the content smoothly.

## What I Can Improve On
One area for improvement is my reliance on notes, as I was not fully delivering the presentation without a script. Additionally, I could have interacted more with the audience and been less nervous. I stayed behind the lectern, which made me feel a bit constrained. Moving around the stage more freely could make me appear more confident and engaging. I aim to be more enthusiastic and dynamic in future presentations.



### [ZHENZIYE LIN]
## What I Did Well
I successfully completed the key feature part. Despite my nervousness, I managed to deliver the required content and finish the presentation as planned.

## What I Can Improve On
This was my first presentation of the semester, and I was extremely nervous, especially since I did not expect such a large audience. In the future, I hope to overcome this nervousness and build more confidence when presenting.
