# MVP Presentation Summary



### [ZHENZIYE LIN]
## What I Did Well
I successfully completed my presentation. Despite my nervousness, I managed to deliver the required content and finish the presentation as planned.

## What I Can Improve On
This was my first presentation of the semester, and I was extremely nervous, especially since I did not expect such a large audience. In the future, I hope to overcome this nervousness and build more confidence when presenting.
