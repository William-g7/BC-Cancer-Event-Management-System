# MVP Presentation Summary



### [Xing Gao]
## What I Did Well
I believe I did a good job of clearly presenting the functionality of the Donor Engagement System. I managed to control the timing effectively and maintained a good overall flow throughout the presentation, ensuring that the audience could follow the content smoothly.

## What I Can Improve On
One area for improvement is my reliance on notes, as I was not fully delivering the presentation without a script. Additionally, I could have interacted more with the audience and been less nervous. I stayed behind the lectern, which made me feel a bit constrained. Moving around the stage more freely could make me appear more confident and engaging. I aim to be more enthusiastic and dynamic in future presentations.



### [ZHENZIYE LIN]
## What I Did Well
I successfully completed the key feature part. Despite my nervousness, I managed to deliver the required content and finish the presentation as planned.

## What I Can Improve On
This was my first presentation of the semester, and I was extremely nervous, especially since I did not expect such a large audience. In the future, I hope to overcome this nervousness and build more confidence when presenting.
